## FlexiCup: Wireless Multimodal Suction Cup with Dual-Zone Vision-Tactile Sensing

FlexiCup is a fully wireless multimodal suction cup that integrates dual-zone vision-tactile sensing. The central zone dynamically switches between vision and tactile modalities via illumination control for contact detection, while the peripheral zone provides continuous spatial awareness for approach planning.

### Key Features

- **Dual-zone vision-tactile sensing**: Central zone with switchable vision-tactile sensing and peripheral zone with continuous spatial awareness
- **Wireless dual-mode suction system**: Fully wireless operation supporting both vacuum and Bernoulli mechanisms through modular configurations
- **Complete wireless autonomy**: Onboard computation and power with 1024×768 image streaming at 30Hz over Wi-Fi
- **Dual control paradigms**: Modular perception-driven grasping (90.0% vacuum, 86.7% Bernoulli) and end-to-end learning with diffusion policies (73.3% and 66.7% success)
